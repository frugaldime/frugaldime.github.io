## Some Ideas to Consider

### The goal isn't to be cheap, but to put your money towards your goals.  Hopefully some you can adopt some of these ideas without a sacrifice, just more money in your account to work for you in time.

Here is a running list of some things I've adopted.  I also plan future posts about these items to provide more detail or will link to external resources.

* Taditional Cable-less repaced with an HD Antenna & internet TV Services
* Voice Over IP (VoIP) with google voice and obitalk
* Waterfall income to accounts to avoide Lifestyle inflation
* Buying what you need when you don't need it
