# Purpose

Having a strong interest in personal financial optimization and striving towards financial freedom and early retirement, this website is being organically composed to be a resource for you to consider applying these principles your own life.

The goal is to identify opportunities to be more economical without sacrificing what is important to you.

Money saved can be applied to your other goals.  I don't plan to write about more common topics that may already have well written artices, but I will link out to them in the [Links](/links/) section.

The [Posts](/) section will be a detailed write-up of the topics I have outlined in the [Ideas](/ideas/) section.

*\* I have not received compensation for any of the posted material.*
